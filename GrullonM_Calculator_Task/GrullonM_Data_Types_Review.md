# Data Types Prompts

## 1) Explain what a literal is?
Literal means exact.
## 2) What is an int? Provide some examples.
Int means integers. ex. 8, 10, 47, -59
## 3) What is a float? Provide some examples.  Show three different ways to represent the number 10 as a float.
Float is a decimal. ex 10.9, 4.2, 1.0, 45.
## 4) What is a string? Provide some examples.
A string is a sequence of characters. ex. "world", "hello"
## 5) Explain the difference between 5, '5', and 5.0.  What can Python do with 5 and 5.0 that it cannot do with '5'?
5 is an int, '5' is a string, 5.0 is a float. What Python can do with 5 and 5.0 but can't do with '5' is a string because it has quotation marks before the number, which shows that it is a sequence of characters.
## 6) Why can't one billion be written as 1,000,000,000? What alternative does Python offer to make one billion easier to read?
One billion can't be written as 1,000,000,000 because it is a lot of zeros. ALso the fact that there is not supposed to be any commas included. The alternative for Python would be 1 x 10^9.
## 7) What is a boolean? Provide some examples.
A boolean is a data ype that shows two disntinct values, true or false, ex 0 == 0, 6 > 4, 10 < 7
## 8) Is the statement 1 == 2 a boolean? Explain why or why not?
1 == 2 is a boolean, this is because it is trying to figure out if 1 is equal to 2, it would be indentified as true or false.
## 9) Is the statement 1 < 2 a boolean? Explain why or why not?
1 < 2 is a boolean, this is because we are trying to identify is 2 is less than  1, it would either be true or false.
## 10) What is the value of the statement True > False?  Explain why.
The value True because it is showing how True is always greater than False. True is 1, while False is 0. 1 is greater than 0.
## 11) Explain the difference between True, true, 'True', and 'true'.
Tru is a boolean because of the capital T, which shows the value true, true is undefined because it does not have quotations, any capital letters, nor it is a number. 'True' and 'true' are string literals because they have quotations before and after the text.
## 12) What type of number does the prefix 0b indicate? Explain what type of number this is.  What value will the command `print(0b11001010)` display? Explain why. (Use 
The type of number the prefix Ob indicates is binary. Binary means to use only the numbers 0 and 1 to show information. The number that will be displayed is 202. This is shown when you use the binary after Ob and use it on the conversion calculator, it will show the number 202. The command will display the number 202 since Python automatically converts binary to decimal.
## 13) What type of number does the prefix 0o indicate? Explain what type of number this is.  What will the command `print(0o510)` display? Explain why.
The number the prefix Oo indicates is octal. Octal shows digits from 0-7. The number that would be shown is 328. The print command is going to display the number 328 because it could convert to original 0o510.
## 14) What type of number does the prefix 0x indicate? Explain what type of number this is.  What will the command `print(0xB24A76)` display? Explain why.
The number the prefic Ox indicates is hexadecimal. A hexadecimal means using 16 symbols, 0-9 and A-F which show numbers in a shorter and simpler way. The number that could be shown is 11684470. The print command would display 11684470 since Python is able to convert the hexadecimal.
## 15) What does 3.2E15 mean?  Describe the magnitude of this number.
3.2E15 means 3.2 x 10^15. The magnitude of this number is 3.2 quadrillion.
## 16) What does 3.2E-15 mean? Describe the magnitude of this number.
3.2E-15 means 3.2 x 10^-15. The magnitude of this number is smaller which is close to zero.
## 17) What function returns the data type of a literal?  Provide an example of how to call this function and display the result.
The function that returns the data type of a literal is a type. ex. type(). Whatever is inside of the type would be shown.
## 18) What does the int() function accomplish.  Provide an example how to call the int() function and display the result.  Provide an exmaple of an argument for the int() function that will generate an error and explain why.
The int() function is able to turn any value into the integer data type. ex. int(72), that would be shown as 72. If int(72.2) it would result in an error because of the decimal point which is a float, not an int.
## 19) What does the float() function accomplish.  Provide an example how to call the float() function and display the result.  Provide an exmaple of an argument for the float() function that will generate an error and explain why.
The float() function is able to conver a value into a float data type. ex. float(81) will be displayed 81.0. An error that could generate is if there is a word inside of the parentheses instead of a number. A word can't be converted into a decimal.
## 20) What does the str() function accomplish.  Provide an example how to call the str() function and display the result.  Provide an exmaple of an argument for the str() function that will generate an error and explain why.
The str() function accomplishes turning any type of value into a string. ex. str(alphabet), this would result in "ABCD..." An error qouls generate if the str() is written incorrectly. An example is if it was written str_(alphabet), since "_" is not supposed to be there, it would result in an error.
## 21) What does the bool() function accomplish.  Provide an example how to call the bool() function and display the result.  Provide an exmaple of an argument for the bool() function that will generate an error and explain why.
The bool() function converts a value into a boolean data type. ex. bool(True > False) the correct answer would be displayed which would be either True or False. The one that would end up in an error would be bool(undefined value), since the value is unkown, the function will not work/
## 22) True or False: Python stores different data types differently in memory.
True, Python stores different data types differently in memory.
