# Print Function Review Prompts

## 1) What is a string?
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes and represented by the data type.

## 2) What are the two different pairs of symbols used in Python to denote strings?
Python uses either single quotes ('') or double quotes ("") to denote strings.

## 3) In general, describe the two types of tasks functions can accomplish.
In general, functions can either perform a task that produces side effects or compute and return a value for use in further processing.

## 4) Explain in detail the syntax used to call functions.
To call a function, write its name followed by parentheses containing any needed arguments, like function_name(value1, value2).

## 5) Explain the difference between a built-in function and a user-defined function.  In your explanation, include an example of a Python built-in function.
A built-in functions is one that comes with Python and is ready to use without writing it yourself, while a user-defined function is one that you create in your code using def to perform a task specific to your program.

## 6) What specifically does the `print()` function do?
The print() function displays text or other output on the screen, making it visible to the user.

## 7) Describe one way to display two different lines of code?
One way to display two different lines is to use two seperate print() statements, with each print() producing its own line.

## 8) Describe one way to display vertical whitespace?
One way to display vertical whitespace is to include blank print() statements whihc output empty lines on the screen.

## 9) Identify and explain how to correct all errors in the function call, `Print[Hello, World!]`.
The function call is incorrect because Print must be lowercase, brackets [] must be changed to parentheses (), and the text must be in quotes, resulting in print("Hello, World!"

## 10) In addition to strings, what else can the `print()` function display?
In addtition to strings, print() can display numbers, variables, expressions, lists, and other data types.
