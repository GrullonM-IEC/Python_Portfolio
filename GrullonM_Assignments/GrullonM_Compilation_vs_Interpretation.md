# Compilation vs Interpretation Review Prompts

## 1) What is the purpose of compiling and/or interpreting programs?
The purpose of compiling and/or interpreting programs is to translate human-readable source code into machine-executable instructions so that a computer can understand and execute the program's commands.
## 2) Describe the compilation process.
The compilation process involves translating the entire source code of a program from a high-level programming language into machine code or an intermediate code, which can then be executed by the computer.
## 3) Describe the interpretation process.
The interpretation process involves reading and executing a program's source code line by line, translating each instruction into machine code on the fly, rather than producing a separate executable file.
## 4) Provide two examples of compiled programming languages.
Two types of compiled programming languages are C and Java.
## 5) Provide two examples of interpreted programming languages.
Two examples of interpreted programming languages are Python and JavaScript.
## 6) Explain the key difference between compiled programming languages and interpreted programming languages?
The key difference is that compiled languages are converted into machine code before execution, while interpreted languages are executed line by line directly from the source code.
## 7) What are the advantages of compiled programming languages?
The advantages of compiled programming languages include faster execution speed, better optimization by the compiler, and improved error detection during the compilation process.
## 8) What are the disadvantages of compiled programming languages?
The disadvantages of compiled programming languages include longer development cycles due to the need for compilation, less flexibility for platform independence, and more difficulty in debugging compared to interpreted languages.
## 9) What are the advantages of interpreted programming languages?
The advantages of interpreted programming languages include easier debuggin, greated platform independence, and faster development cycles since code can be tested and modified without the need for compilation.
## 10) What are the disadvantages of interpreted programming languages?
The disadvantages of interpreted programming languages include slower execution speed, higher resource consumption, and potentially less efficient error detection compared to compiled languages.
## 11) Explain what source code is.
Source code is the human-readable set of instructions written in a programming language that defines what a computer should do.
## 12) Explain what a script is.
A script is a type of program written in an interpreted language that automates tasks or controls the behavior of other programs, typically executed line by line without prior compilation.
